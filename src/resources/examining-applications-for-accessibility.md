  and consider appropriate activities for coding instruction with their students
  who experience learning challenges. "

The considerations outlined below include those that should be considered within the design interface as well as instructional supports, such as pre-teaching, scaffolded instruction, and adapted resources to support explicit and accessible instruction.

## General Information

* Name of Application:
* Cost:
* Website:
* Device Requirements:
* Student needs to consider: 

  * Reading
  * Writing
  * Cognitive
  * Visual perception
  * Fine motor

## Accessibility Considerations

Think about each of the following potential barriers and how inaccessible they make this application for your student. Rate the severity of the barrier (0-5)

### Reading Potential Barriers

* There are text instructions that require reading (i.e. are not presented auditorily or supported by images).
* Text is used to label/categorize and is not accessible auditorily or supported by images.
* There is challenging vocabulary used that is not explained.
* There are tooltips/hints that require reading (i.e. are not presented auditorily or supported by images).

### Writing Potential Barriers

* Students are required to type correctly spelled commands in order to carry out tasks.
* Students are required to type correctly spelled commands in order to carry out tasks.

### Cognitive Potential Barriers

* Students are required to store information and recall it later to carry out a task.
* Students are required to follow a large number of steps sequentially that are not broken down.
* Students are required to have an understanding /prior knowledge of certain concepts in order to carry out tasks. (i.e. left/right, sequencing)
* Students are required to follow fast-paced instructions.
* Students are required to follow instructions that are provided auditorily but not visually.
* Students are required to navigate across multiple screens.

### Visual Perceptual Potential Barriers

* Students are required to have good spatial awareness to carry out the task.

### Fine Motor Potential Barriers

* Students are required to move items seamlessly using a small, single point of contact (i.e. finger)
* Students are required to manipulate small objects in close proximity.
* Students are required to effectively use a mouse (i.e. for scrolling, clicking, and dragging)
* Students are required to perform complex gestures to carry out tasks. (i.e. pinch, 3 finger tap)
* Students are required to put together small pieces of machinery.
* Students are required to use small tools.
* Students use alternate access devices for keyboard and mouse functions.

## Potential Solution Ideas

### Reading

* Text to speech tools
* Dictionary tools
* Word wall with symbols
* Colour coding

### Writing

* Word prediction tool
* Speech input tool
* Option cards
* Partner assisted scanning
* Alternate keyboard

### Cognitive

* Visual step by step sequences
* Checklists 
* Anchor activity
* Picture supports
* Guided practice
* Repetition with variety
* Adapt physical materials
* Provide replicas of materials to isolate concepts

### Visual Perceptual

* Anchor activity
* Visual replicas of materials to isolate concepts
* Manipulatives (i.e. ribbon, blocks, stickers)
* Directionality- bridge the gap between person and objects through physical orientation (i.e. identifying left/right of an object facing a different direction)
* Adapt abstract materials to make them more concrete

### Fine Motor

* Use of stylus
* Modifications of selection tool
* Adjustment of accessibility settings
* Gesture creation
* Use of external alternate access devices
* Partner assisted scanning
* Modification/adaptation of concrete manipulatives



**NOTE**: Be sure to check the compatibility of a studentâ€™s current support products with the coding application(s) being considered. Also, consider whether the use of the products requires instruction prior to expecting them to support coding instruction.
