## Description

In this activity, learners plan and build a path to direct Dash to move to a specific object on a grid map.

## Steps

* Place the printed grid tiles together on a hard and flat surface and tape their edges to secure it in place
* Once your map is ready, place a few items such as toys on different spots on the map
* Select a starting point for your robot, place it on the map and start using the coding environment to make your robot move to different items on the map

## Tips

* If you are doing this activity on a tabletop or an elevated surface, block the edges to prevent robots from falling
* If you don’t have access to a printer, you can draw a grid map on a large sheet of paper or use masking tape to build a grid on the floor
* You can use any object, draw or write something on the map
* To make this fun, build a story around the objects on your map and give Dash a specific mission to accomplish

## Change it up

* Try different colors and marker tips to get different effects

## Level Up 

* Complete this activity again with a planned shape or pattern

## Skill Development
