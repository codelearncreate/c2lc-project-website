* Connect Block.ly or Weavly to Dash or Dot
* Use the Block.ly or Weavly blocks to create a sequence for the robot you connected with
* Find the setting panel for light
* Select 3 different light options to see on Dash or Dot
* Find the setting panel for sound
* Select 3 different sound options to see on Dash or Dot
* Adjust the parameters for your selected blocks, such as changing color or sound
* Play your sequence to see how Dash or Dot is performing your program

## Tips

* Ensure batteries are charged and Dash and Dot is operational prior to the activity
* Set up space with dim light and a relatively quiet environment to detect visual and/or audio changes

## Skill Development

* Planning 
* Sequencing

## Level Up
