## Description

In this activity, learners will use Weavly to apply their knowledge of directions, sequencing, and loop creation. Learners will use their familiarity with Weavly or Block.ly and Dash and Dot robots to create loop sequences in real-time. The kinesthetic output from the robots will encourage sequence tracking, an early task necessary for debugging and correction. This activity incorporates a social component to encourage demonstration and collaboration.

## Steps

Select one individual to be Player 1 and another to be Player 2.

* Using only words, Player 1 tells Player 2 a simple sequence of 3-5 blocks you would like to repeat. This will be your ‘loop’ sequence
* Player 2 creates the loop sequence that Player 1 has described in Weavly or Block.ly. (Do not let Player 1 see your program until you are finished.)
* Player 2 connects Weavly or Block.ly to Dash
* Player 2 plays their program to move Dash
* Discuss with the other player if the played sequence what Player 1 had described
* If it was not the sequence as Player 1 described, try to find where the sequence did not match what and fix the sequence
* Switch roles and repeat the activity 

## Tips

* Ensure batteries are charged and Dash and Dot is operational prior to the activity
* Set up a large flat surface for Dash and Dot to detect actions
* Establish expectations of being patient and turn-taking between partners

## Skill Development

* Debugging
* Sequencing
