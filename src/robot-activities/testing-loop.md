## Description

In this activity, learners will use the on-screen environment to apply their knowledge of directions, sequencing and loop creation. The purpose of this interactive activity is to allow learners to test their loop sequences. Learners will use their familiarity with the “C2LC Coding environment” or Block.ly and Dash and Dot robots to create loop sequences in real-time. The kinesthetic output from the robots will encourage sequence tracking, an early task necessary for debugging and correction. This activity incorporates a social component to encourage demonstration and collaboration.

## Steps

Select one individual to be Partner 1 and another to be Partner 2.

* Using only words, Partner 1 tells Partner 2 a simple sequence of 3-5 blocks you would like to repeat. This will be your ‘loop’ sequence.
* Partner 2 creates the loop sequence that Partner 1 has described in Blockly. Do not let Partner 1 see your program until you are finished.
* Partner 2 to send the program to Dash/Dot to share with Partner 1.
* Switch roles and repeat the activity (Partner 1 becomes Partner 2. Partner 2 becomes Partner 1)

## Try

* Ensure batteries are charged and Dash and Dot is operational prior to activity
* Set up a large flat surface for Dash and Dot to detect actions
* Establish expectations of being patient and turn-taking between partners

## Change it up

1. Discuss with your partner if the sequence shown is the sequence Partner 1 described.
2. If it was not the sequence as Partner 1 described, try to find where the sequence did not match what Partner 1 described.
