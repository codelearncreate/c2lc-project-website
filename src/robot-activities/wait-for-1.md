## Description

Conditions can affect what the robot does, such as pause programming until that condition is met. In this activity, Dash and Dot will stop and wait for a specific event to happen before they can finish the program. Larners are introduced to conditional blocks that help Dash and Dot make decisions.  Learners will explore the 'Wait for' and 'Wait for “x” seconds blocks' on Weavly or Block.ly in the Control category with Repeat blocks. Learners will learn to recognize the events that can prompt the wait for conditions to take place until an event occurs or a set amount of time has passed.





Sequencing is an abstract concept and takes a lot of practice to master for many kids. Learners can try these activities to understand how a series of objects and events can happen in a specific and logical order. The following activities include simple sequences that are familiar to children and are a natural part of their daily routines.

* Brushing teeth \[N steps]: \[Link]
* Growing a plant \[N steps]: \[Link]
* Making a sand castle \[N steps]: \[Link]

## Steps

**Introduce**

1. Place vocabulary cards: 'conditionals', 'event' and 'wait for' 
2. Introduce the conditionals block as the setting used to help robots, such as Dash and Dot, to stop and check for certain conditions or events before they perform the next task
3. Introduce the 'Wait for' block as the setting to help robots, such as Dash and Dot, to wait for a specific event to happen before the program can be finished
4. Under the control category, find the "Wait for" and "Wait for 'x' seconds" blocks with the Repeat blocks

**Anchor**

1. Place the vocabulary card 'event' in front
2. Review Event A and Event B where a wait for is part of the sequence. Identify what can happen before, the wait time and what can happen after to learner.

   * Event A: We get upset (what happens before), 'x' time (wait time), talk about it (what happens after)
   * Event B: We put food in the microwave (what happens before), 'x' time (wait time), take it out (what happens after)
3. Provide pictures of events with wait time. Ask learners to identify what was happening before (actions leading up to the wait for), the event that triggers us to continue the task (condition during wait for time), and what happens after that event occurs (actions taking place after wait for time)
4. Ask learners to imagine how the "wait for" block can get Dash and Dot to wait until an event to happen before continuing (refer to slide 14-15)

   Select how long a robot will wait for and enter the time in the parameter window on the 'Wait for "x" seconds' block

**Model**

1. Open Weavly or Block.ly app to create a program using the "wait for" to play Catch with Dot.
2. Think aloud with the steps Dot will do to play catch and drag blocks onto the canvas that follows: 

   * Play Dot Catch
   * Wait for Dot Toss
   * Say Dot Wee
3. Attach this sequence to the When Start block
4. Run program
5. Discuss whether prediction(s) were correct or not

## Tips

* Test program and count the seconds for the "Wait for" out loud

## Skill Development

* Analytical/Planning

## Level Up

Add additional 'Wait for' conditional blocks for a more complex sequence
