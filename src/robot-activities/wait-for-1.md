## Description

In this activity, learners are introduced to the Wait for Blocks. Learners will explore the Wait for and Wait for “x” seconds blocks on blockly. Learners will learn how conditions can affect what the robot does, such as pause programming until that condition is met. Learners will learn to recognize the events that can prompt the wait for conditions to take place until an event occurs or a set amount of time has passed.

## Steps

Introduce and anchor

1. Introduce conditions and place vocabulary cards: "conditionals", and "wait for" in front. Read the definition of these vocabulary (and refer to slide 3) 

2. Identity the parameter window on the wait for "x" seconds block to review how long a robot will wait for (refer to slide 3)

3. Provide events (refer to slide 5-7) and identify what can happen before, the wait time and what can happen after using the vocabulary card: event

4. Consider events with wait time (refer to slide 8-13) and emphasize what was happening before (actions leading up to the wait for), the event that triggers us to continue the task, and what happens after that event occurs

5. Imagine how the "wait for" block can get Dash and Dot to wait until an event to happen before continuing (refer to slide 14-15)

Model

1. Open Blockly app to create a program using the "wait for" to play Catch with Dot.

2. Think aloud with the steps Dot will do to play catch and drag blocks onto the canvas that follows: Play Dot Catch, Wait for Dot Toss, Say Dot Wee and attach sequence to the When Start block and run program.

3. Discuss whether prediction(s) were correct or not

4. Think aloud as additional blocks are added: Dance Dot Happy, Wait for Dot Shake, Expression Dot Dizzy, and emphasize the "wait for". Add two blocks, Wait for 3 seconds and Expression Dot Laugh

5. Test program and count the seconds for the "Wait for".
