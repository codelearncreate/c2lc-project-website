## Description

In this activity, learners try building very simple programs to move Dash in and out of its house and to visit a neighbor’s house. The purpose of this activity is to connect the on-screen experience with the robot movement in the physical environment and help learners to practice building a program to achieve a specific yet simple goal.

## Steps

* Find two doll houses, or build them with Lego or cardboard, or just draw two pictures of different houses, one for Dash and one for its neighbour
* Place the two houses 3ft apart. And place Dash in front of its house
* Open “C2LC Coding Environment” or Block.ly. and connect with Dash robot
* Use the coding environment to make Dash move outside of its house (Possibly two Forwards)
* Use the coding environment to take Dash back inside its house (Possibly two 90 degree turns and two forwards)
* Next, try taking dash out of its house and move it to the neighbour’s house for tea!

## Tips

* Ensure batteries are charged and Dash and Dot is operational prior to activity
* Once Dash is taking an incorrect step, moderators can pause and work with players about how to fix (debug) the program and take Dash back to the right path

## Level Up

* Add other objects or toys in the environment that are farther from Dash’s house and instruct learners to take Dash to those items and return it to its house afterwards.

## Skill Development

* Sequencing
