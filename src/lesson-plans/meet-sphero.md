## Description

In this activity, learners can explore different movements and visual and audio options for Sphero. As they try its different features, they will become familiar with Sphero's control settings. This activity encourages learners to use their sensory abilities to identify cause and effect.

* Explore how Sphero moves
* Explore different distances
* Explore light colours
* Explore different types of lines (e.g. straight vs curved)

## Tips

* Ensure batteries are charged and Sphero is operational prior to activity
* Set up a space with dim light and a relatively quiet environment to detect visual changes

## Change it up:

* Complete this activity again with different setting options that were not chosen before, if any remain

## Level Up

* Complete this activity with at least one selection of each explored parameter

## Curriculum Connections

## Accessibility Considerations

* Lighting and contrast for low vision

## Skill Development

* Learning about directions
* Planning and building a sequence
