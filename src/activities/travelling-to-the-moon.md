## Description

In this activity, learners try to build a simple sequence to move on a straight path between point A and point B. This activity will help learners to explore the Weavly coding environment and try different action blocks.

Activity: \[link]

## Steps

* Open the activity link
* Add \[n] forward blocks to the program
* Select play to see how the spacecraft will move from earth to the moon
* Select the “Refresh” button to take the spacecraft back to its original spot
* Now you need to add a few more steps to the program to bring the spacecraft back to earth
* This time you will need to use a turn block to go back to earth
* Once your spacecraft is pointing towards earth, add forward blocks to take it back to earth
* Select the “Play” button and watch how the spacecraft travels between the earth and the moon

## Tips

* Adult moderators can show the movements to help learners understand the purpose of the activity
* When the built sequence is incorrect, moderators can pause the program and encourage learners to find a way to fix (debug) their program

## Skill Development

* Debugging
* Directional
* Planning
* Spatial
* Sequencing

## Level Up!

Moderators or learners can adjust the placement of the moon, earth, and the spacecraft to encourage building different program combinations.
