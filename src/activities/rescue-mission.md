## Objectives

## Description

These are a series of activities that add to the complexity of building a program. In the initial missions, learners can only use Forward action blocks. In the following missions, learners need to use Turns at different degrees to complete their missions.

* Mission#1: link \[\*\**]
* Mission#2: link \[\*\**]
* Mission#3: link \[\*\**]
* Mission#4: link \[\*\**]
* Mission#5: link \[\*\**]

## Steps

* Open missions in order and don’t move to the next mission unless you have completed the current one
* Depending on the mission, use different combinations of Forward and Turn blocks to build your program
* Select the “Play” button to see how each mission is completed

## Tips

* Adult moderators can show the movements to help learners understand the purpose of the activity
* Once a goal is reached, moderators can encourage learners to think about other potential ways they could have tried to get to the same destination

## Skill Development

* Directions
* Sequencing

## Level Up!

* Moderators can restrict the number of allowed action blocks in the program to encourage learners to plan the shortest path to a destination.
