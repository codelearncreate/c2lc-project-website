## Description

In this activity, learners use the Weavly coding environment to create a musical piece. Using the different action blocks and speed adjustment, learners can build a sequence with the sonification feature to create a musical piece.

## Steps

* Open the Weavly coding environment.
* Build a program with up to 10 similar action blocks to make a rhythm and play the rhythm.
* Replace 1-2 action blocks with other action blocks and play the rhythm.
* Replace another 1-2 action blocks and play the rhythm.
* Try to play your piece at different speeds and notice the differences. 

## Tips

* It helps if moderators play the action blocks and demonstrate the sounds associated with each action block.
* Encourage learners to share musical piece with peers.

## Skill Development

* Sequencing
* Musical 
* Communication/Social

## Level Up!

Ask learners to change their character's starting position on the scene before playing their piece. Encourage them to try different starting positions and notice how it changes the sonification sound when the piece is being played.
