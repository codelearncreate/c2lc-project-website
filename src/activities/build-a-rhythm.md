## Description

In this activity, learners use the Weavly coding environment to create a musical piece. Each action block on Weavly is paired with a unique sound. When selecting action blocks, these sounds can act as notes to a song or musical piece. Using the different action blocks and speed adjustment, learners can build a sequence with the sound feature to create a musical piece.

Example of a rhythm that was built step by step:\

## Steps

* Open the Weavly coding environment.
* Build a program with up to 10 similar action blocks to make a rhythm and play the rhythm.
* Replace 1-2 action blocks with other action blocks and play the rhythm.
* Replace another 1-2 action blocks and play the rhythm.
* Adjust the speed for the piece and play the rhythm. 

## Tips

* It helps if moderators play the action blocks and demonstrate the sounds associated with each action block.
* Encourage learners to share musical piece with peers.

## Skill Development

* Sequencing
* Musical 
* Communication/Social

## Level Up!

Ask learners to change their character's starting position on the scene before playing their piece. Encourage them to try different starting positions and notice how it changes the sonification sound when the piece is being played.
