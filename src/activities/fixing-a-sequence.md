## Description

In this simple and interactive game, moderators and players work together to find the correct order of events. The moderator will perform a daily routine, such as making a jelly sandwich in an incorrect order or skipping the main step. Now, this is the learnerâ€™s turn to save the day and tell the moderator how to correct the order of the events to complete the task.

## Steps

* Pick a daily activity that the learner is familiar with, such as making a jelly sandwich, dressing up for outside, taking a shower, brushing your teeth, etc.
* While you are performing that task, misplace one of the steps or skip it
* Ask learners about what went wrong and how you can fix things together

## Tips

* Try to create situations that are fun and engaging for the learner
* In situations in which the learner does not recognize the missed or misplaced step, perform the activity again in the correct order and explain the correct sequence of actions and events

## Skill Development

* Sorting
* Pattern recognition
