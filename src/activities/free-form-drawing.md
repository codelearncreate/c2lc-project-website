## Objectives

* Drawing a shape and saving it as a custom block for your program

## Description

In this activity, learners use the C2LCâ€™s drawing canvas to create a drawing. They will have a set of basic tools to change their drawings. Learners are able to use touch or their AT to draw on this virtual canvas. Then, they can save their drawings as a custom action block and use it anywhere in their program. Learners are able to reopen these blocks and change their drawings later on**.**

## Steps

* Open the drawing canvas in C2LC coding environment
* Use the drawing tools to draw something on the canvas
* Give your drawing a name and save it as a custom action block
* Learners can insert these drawings into their program anywhere in their sequence

## Tips

* It helps if moderators demonstrate this activity first and show learners how to use different tools to make some basic shapes

## Skill Development

## Level Up!

* Ask learners to re-open their custom block and change different qualities, such as color, size, position, or line thickness
