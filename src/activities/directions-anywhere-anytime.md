## Description

This activity helps learners to explore and practice their directions. Telling the difference between right and left can be difficult for many learners. Yet, that is one of the most basic concepts required in most coding environments. In this activity, learners start by learning directions on their own body, then relate to objects to the left and right of their body, and finally relate to the position of one object in relation to another. Children can learn about directions through a wide range of examples in their daily routines. Repeating these activities helps learners to learn about their directions in their immediate environment before moving to a virtual environment.

## Steps

* To practice learning about direction on our own bodies, you can create a list of activities you do from morning until evening

  * Highlight activities that lend themselves to reinforcing left and right, such as getting dressed and pulling arms and legs through sleeves/pants, brushing teeth (Which hand holds the tooth brush and which side they are brushing), setting the table (left and right side of the plate for form and knife/spoon), where people are relative to learner while sitting on the couch, etc.
  * Talk to learners about their direction during any of the highlighted activities throughout the day
* Another activity to learn about direction on our own body is to play a game, such as Simon says, using directions such as “Simon says Raise your right hand”, Simon says “Shake your left leg”, etc.
* To practice learning about our body position in relation to objects outside our bodies, place similar objects (these can be animals, shapes, etc.) on the floor to the left and right of the learner

  * Ask the learner to walk to, hop to, etc. the circle on the left, the triangle on the right, etc. You can also play Simon Says with this part of the activity
* To practice learning about the position of objects relative to one another, you can draw a line down the middle of a piece of paper or a poster board

  * Place a pile of two different types of objects on the floor and ask the child to sort by placing all of the forks on the left and the knives on the right side of the paper, all the pigs on the left side and the horses on the right side, etc.

## Tips

* Consider providing learners with a visual representation for left and right, such as using a different colour nail polish on the left and right, placing a different colour sticker on left and right hands or using bracelets that are two distinct colours
* Select activities that learners like and enjoy doing

## Skill Development

Directional skills to understand basic direction

## Level Up!

* Try this activity in different environments, such as outdoor spaces, playgrounds, streets, supermarkets. For example, when driving, talk to them about turning right/left, or going straight; or in a supermarket, ask them about items on the right, left, front, and back shelves
