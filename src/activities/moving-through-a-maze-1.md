## Description

This activity provides a combination of physical and on-screen experiences for learners. This is a goal-based activity, thus learners need to plan, execute and debug (if needed) to go through the maze. This activity requires collaboration and communication between players to reach a final destination.

## Steps

* Use masking tape to build a simple maze on the floor
* Place some of learners’ favorite toys/treats on different spots on the maze
* Ask player 1 to wait at the beginning of the maze and moves only when the program announces an action
* Ask player 2 to use the C2LC coding environment to builds a program to move player 1 through the maze
* Select the “Play” button and ask player 1 to move based on the steps announced by the program

## Tips

* Start with straight and simple paths before introducing more complex mazes
* You can use grid squares to build your maze as some learners may benefit from seeing the grid squares to navigate
* Reward both players if they successfully finish going through the maze
* Moderator can pause the program and help player 2 to fix (debug) the program if player 1 starts to move off the maze
* In addition to the audio labels spoken by the program, moderator can speak each action block once played to reinforce the learning of directions

## Skill Development

* Directions
* Sequencing

## Level Up!

* Once your players are familiar with this activity, get them to make their own maze.
