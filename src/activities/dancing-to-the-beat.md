## Description

You can use any coding environment to do this activity. This is a fun and interactive way of learning about directions. Any type of movement counts as dancing in this activity whether it is stepping, jumping, wheeling, blinking, head movements, or hitting a single switch.

As a starter, you can try

For younger children:

* [Wealy Pre-built Program](https://build.codelearncreate.org/?v=0.5&p=1Bb1bB1Bb1Bb1&c=e0b00a0a0b0b0c0c0d0d0e0) 
* [Dance music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwKS4b9aUeI)

For youth

* [Weavly Pre-built Program](https://build.codelearncreate.org/?v=0.5&p=ADad1B1b1B1b1dD&c=00b)
* [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niUaRPODJRs)[Dance music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niUaRPODJRs)

## Steps

* Select a short song or music your players like
* Use Weavly to build a sequence of actions
* Line up your players
* Ask them to follow each step of the program that is announced
* Play the music and your program at once and let the fun begin

## Tips

* Announce every step of the program as it is executed
* For longer songs, you can replay the same program
* Try to keep them focused on the running program and correct their movements

## Skill Development

* Gross motor movements (i.e. dance)
* Directions
* Sequencing

## Level Up!

Once your players are familiar with this activity, get them to write their own programs. You can also pair them in teams and make them create a dance competition.
