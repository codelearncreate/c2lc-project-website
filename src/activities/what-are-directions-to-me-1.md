## Description

This activity helps learners to explore and practice their directions. Distinguishing forward, right, and left can be challenging for many learners. Players will use their body to orient and associate directions relative to themselves. Repetition is the key to creating a foundational understanding of coding. Thus, try to use any available examples around the learner before moving to a virtual space.

## Steps

* Review through the vocabulary of directions
* Ask the learner to point in the direction that matches each vocabulary item
* Ask the learner to identify which arm is right and left
* Encourage learners to move according to each vocabulary item

## Tips

* If a learner struggles with identifying the correct direction, let the learner say the incorrect answer and then provide the correction. On subsequent attempts, try to provide verbal or physical prompts to engage participation.
* Use colored bracelets or stickers to support left and right to be remembered. Red and yellow are good choices for individuals with CVI.
* Repetition is key for learning directions with physical movement. Try to reinforce with other activities with directions.
