## Description

This activity engages learners to recognize events in a story and practice sequencing. Children's stories include simple sequences with which most kids are familiar. Understanding the logical order of events in a story helps learners to recognize sequences. Sequencing is an abstract concept and it takes a lot of practice to master. Developing this skill helps build the foundation for block coding.

## Steps

* Pick a story with which the learner is familiar
* Show the pictures of events for the story and engage the learner to describe what can be noticed or what is happening
* Ask the learner how they think the story would occur and order the pictures accordingly

## Tips

* Try another story that would be funny or engaging for the learner
* In situations in which the learner does not recognize the missed or misplaced step, perform the activity again in the correct order and explain the correct sequence of actions and events

## Skill Development

* Sequencing (e.g. putting plot into correct order)
