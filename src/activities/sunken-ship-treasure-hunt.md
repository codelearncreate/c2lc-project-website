## Objectives

* Building a sequence to achieve a goal

## Description

In this activity, learners try to build a sequence to move their on-screen character from point A to point B. The path between these two points is not straight. There are roadblocks, like sharks, along the way. The character will need to stay away from these roadblocks. While building a sequence, learners will become familiar with the C2LC coding environment.

Activity: link \[\*\**]

## Steps

* Open the activity link
* Use a combination of action blocks to program a sequence to take your submarine to the sunken ship while moving around the sharks
* Select play to see how the submarine will move from the sea surface to the sunken ship
* Select the “Refresh” button to take the submarine back to its original spot
* Select the “Play” button and watch how the submarine moves from the surface to the sunken ship and returning to the surface while avoiding sharks on its path

## Tips

* Adult moderators can show the movements to help learners understand the purpose of the activity
* When the built sequence is incorrect, moderators can pause the program and encourage learners to find a way to fix (debug) their program

## Skill Development

* Sequencing
* Debugging

## Level Up!

* Moderators or learners can adjust the placement of the submarine, sunken ship, and the sharks to encourage building different program combinations
