## Description

This activity will help learners to build the basic foundation for using any block-based coding environments, such as C2LC. Learners can use Lego blocks to build a sequence of actions and then use a toy to run those actions in their physical environment.

## Steps

* Choose three different colors of Lego blocks (green for forward, red for turning right, yellow for turning left)
* With markers, draw a straight arrow on the face of the green block, a turn left arrow on the face of the yellow block, and a turn right arrow on the face of the red Lego block.
* Ask the learner to assemble these blocks in different orders
* Use a toy as your robot
* Ask the learner to move the toy based on the Lego sequence (it might help to create a grid through which to move the toy robot)

## Tips

* Ask the learner to try different combinations
* Try to provide three or more of each color Lego blocks to allow for further explorations and building more complex sequences
* While you are representing each step in the sequence with a toy, speak the label of the block, such as “Move Forward”, “Turn Right”, and “Turn Left” to reinforce the learning about directions
* If you use bracelets or stickers to support remembering right and left, make sure their colors match the color of Lego blocks you use for turn right and left

## Skill Development

* Sequencing 

## Level Up!

* Give learners a few plain Lego blocks and encourage them to draw an action or add a sticker on the block and add them to their sequence. Adding actions, such as jump, dance, spin, say hooray, etc. will prompt their creativity and lead to exploring different combinations of actions in a sequence
