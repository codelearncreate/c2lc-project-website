## Description

This activity helps learners to identify groups and categories of items around them. They can categorize items based on their color, shape, size, and texture, or their function. Most coding environments include categories of different tools and features. Learning about categories will help learners to easier navigate and operate those virtual environments. It also helps learners to expand their vocabulary and sorting skills. Here are 3 different ways you can do this activity. After any of the above activities, ask learners what attributes they used to find an item or to sort them into different groups

1. Find an area in your immediate environment where items are categorized, such as drawers of clothing in the bedroom, the pantry in the kitchen, stationary shelves in the garage, etc. Ask learners how items are categorized in those areas
2. Put labels/picture representing the categories on the cupboard doors and ask the learner to find an item (e.g. a fork)
3. Jumble up a pile of items on the floor and ask the child to sort them into groups

## Tips

* When picking the categories/groups for this activity, make sure learners are familiar with the vocabulary
* An initial assessment helps moderators to identify the category groups which learners are familiar with

## Skill Development

* Sorting
* Recognizing patterns

## Level Up!

Open a virtual coding environment, such as Weavly.org and show learners how the blocks are sorted into categories.
