## Description

This is a multi-level activity that starts simple and builds in complexity. The different scene of each activity creates a mission for the on-screen character. Learners will build a sequence of different actions to help their on-screen character complete its mission.

* Jungle Safari: \[Link]
* Farm Visit: \[Link]

## Steps

* Pick an activity link
* Choose an animal you want to visit
* Use a combination of different action blocks to build a program to move your character on the grid and reach your selected animal
* Select the “Play” button to run the program and view how the on-screen character completes each step of the activity
* To visit another animal, select the “Delete” button to delete your current program
* Start building a new one

## Tips

* Adult moderators can show the movements to help learners understand the purpose of the activity
* Learners can leave the pen down feature enabled to draw a line as they move between the steps
* Once a goal is reached, moderators can encourage learners to think about other potential ways to get to the same animal
* Animals sounds can be played once the learners complete the activity to celebrate and add excitement

## Skill Development

* Planning
* Directional
* Spatial
* Sequencing
* Debugging

## Level Up!

Learners can create their own program to add a specific challenge to their mission. An example would be picking up a farmer on their way to visit a farm animal or avoiding quick sand in their jungle safari adventure.
