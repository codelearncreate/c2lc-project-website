## Description

This is a multi-level activity that starts simple and builds in complexity. The different scene of each activity creates a mission for the on-screen character. Learners will build a sequence of different actions to help their on-screen character complete its mission.

* Traveling to the moon: \[link]
* Growing a plant: \[Link]
* Baking a cake: \[Link]

## Steps

* Pick an activity link
* Help the learner to build the program to go to each step of the activity
* Select the “Play” button to run the program and view how the on-screen character completes each step of the activity

## Tips

* Learners can leave the pen down feature enabled to draw a line as they move between the steps.

## Skill Development

## Level Up!

Learners can create their own program to add a specific challenge to their mission. An example would be picking up a Martian friend on Planet B on the "Traveling to the moon" mission.
