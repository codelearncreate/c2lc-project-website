## Description

This is a multi-level activity. First, learners are introduced to the concept of robots. Later they are engaged in different activities to identify robots in their immediate environment.

To introduce them to robots you can use available videos on YouTube or read a picture book about robots. Our team is particularly fond of these resources as they provide details that are fun and engaging:

* Video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wHJjLMnikU>

## Steps

* Show the introductory video
* Talk with learners about the main characteristic of robots
* Use this [card deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VcOVXDzhnh6ybTqe7nRcTpBR5nf_g5mD/view?usp=sharing) to provide each learner with two options to choose the one that is a robot
* Talk to them about their choices
* Ask each learner to look around in their immediate environment and try to find anything that could be a robot and describe their reasons
* If there is a robot available, demonstrate building a simple program and making the robot move based on your program

## Tips

* Make sure any video played for this activity has captions and is played at the proper speed
* Reflecting on learnersâ€™ choices is core to this activity. Even when they choose the wrong options make sure to discuss why their choice is not a robot

## Skill Development

* Giving instructions
