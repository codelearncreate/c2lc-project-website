## Description

This activity provides a combination of physical and on-screen experiences for learners. This is a goal-based activity, thus learners need to plan, execute and debug (if needed) to move a robot towards a specific destination. This activity requires collaboration and communication between players.

## Steps

* Ask player 1 to go to a specific spot in the environment, such as a far corner in the room
* Ask player 1 to act as a robot and only follow the Weavly program as it’s being spoken
* Select a specific destination in the same environment
* Moderator works with player 2 to build a sequence of action blocks in the Weavly coding environment to bring player 1 to the selected destination
* Select the “Play” button to see whether player 1 gets to the final destination or not

## Tips

* Start with straight paths before introducing turns
* Reward both players if they successfully complete the mission
* Moderator can pause the program and help player 2 to debug and replace action blocks that moves player 1 away from the destination
* In addition to the audio labels spoken by the program, the moderator can speak each action block as they are executed to reinforce the learning about directions

## Skill Development

* Directions
* Sequencing
* Debugging

## Level Up!

* The moderator and players can switch roles. This time, players get to control the moderator and bring them back to the desired destination
* You can use some of the available objects in the environment, such as furniture as roadblocks so your players can build more complex programs
* If the “robot” is blindfolded, it will help learners to notice the importance of clear and precise directions.
