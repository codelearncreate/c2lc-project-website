## Description

In this activity, learners will use their knowledge of sequencing to create repeated sequences, known as loops. This is an unplugged activity and will give learners a chance to practice planning a loop without a computer and with items around them.

## Steps

* Pick three series of similar items, such as forks, spoons, straws, post-it notes, clothing, loose parts, etc.
* Use these items to build a sequence with a repeated pattern to show the learner what this activity is about
* Ask the learner to make their own sequence with a repeated pattern
* Ask the learner to repeats this pattern 3 times in their sequence

## Tips

* Set up a large flat surface for items
* In situations in which the learner is not able to repeat the sequence, slow your pace and work with them to build the repeated sequence step by step

## Skill Development

* Sequencing
* Planning
* Recognizing repeated patterns

## Level Up!

* Try a loop sequence with one item being used twice (e.g. Spoon, fork, fork, Spoon, fork, fork)
* Try this activity again with a longer loop sequence (e.g. Spoon, fork, fork, straw, Spoon, fork, fork, straw)
